# Exploring /r/kpop discussion

### Introduction / Motivation

Do /r/kpop commenters talk differently about male vs. female groups?

Initial exploration of this question:
- Identify submissions on 2 all-male groups, 2 all-female groups
- Collect their comments
- Contrast comments in general to "typical" reddit language (using /r/funny as a standard)
- Contrast comments on male group vs female group 
  - Separate out into comments for different groups
    - e.g. What adjectives are most associated with which groups?
  - What sort of emojis are used?

### Data Collection
