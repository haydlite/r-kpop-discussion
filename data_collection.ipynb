We all knew from the beginning that she would recover. It's the uncertainty after recovery that I'm worried about. It just might be too troublesome continue her career after because injuries can have lasting effects on the human body long after recovery.

I'm just expressing my frustrations that such shitty working environments are created for idols in the first place, let alone all the other crap they go through. I don't really care about the extent of the compensation that they would offer only that even if they were to comprehensively cover her fees and loss of profits, it'd be the bare minimum for the injury that she sustained whilst performing there.\\n\\nI can't imagine why you're interested in still contesting this apart from either bring a #hailcorporate type or a contrarian for the sake of it.

This stuff is nearly always handled behind closed doors to make it easier on everyone involved, including Wendy.\\n\\n&gt; I'm just angry/concerned for Wendy because so often it's the individual who gets screwed over by large companies due to things like work injuries and hazards\\n\\nMy entire point is we don't actually know that as most of the time these things aren't public.
