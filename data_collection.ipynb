They check your personal references, workplace reference, check my parents background (when I was already hired my boss said to the group something like \"her dad works in X and was assigned in X\" which I did not reveal in my application) and even go where you live.\\n\\nI definitely think they can do more rigorous background checks on the 10s of trainees they accept each year. If that is too much then they can do it one year after if the trainee remained with the company and shown great potential to debut.\\n\\nIt will definitely not be perfect. If your bullying is confined to a few people and hidden it\\'ll be hard to track it down. There\\'ll also be malicious accusations. But if someone is a known school or class bully (like Hyunjin appears to be) then it\\'ll be possible to corroborate claims.',\n",
