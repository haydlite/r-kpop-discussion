If anything SM making a statement just gives the groups and idols under them a free pass from making a statement on their own. \n\nIf YG, again one of the top labels, is seen as a culture vulture and definitely profiting off black culture based on your statements where is the campaigns towards them to speak out about BLM? Just because specific idols have more difficulties in speaking out or have been ignorant in the past does that mean they are just left alone? Why is SKZ on a different standard compared to them? \n\nThere are also some hip hop and rap heavy groups in kpop and a lot have also used styles from those genres in their aesthetic.

Those are clear examples of marketing towards the west another one is SuperM. I think this perception that Stray Kids are marketed towards the west is just because they are featured in western media.

And many students felt self-conscious in such revealing bottoms, particularly when they were dealing with the body changes brought on by adolescence.\n\nSuch complaints were borne largely in silence until the early 1990s. Most sources trace the anti-burumƒÅ movement to the Japanese school in Singapore, where in 1993 students opposed an effort by the school to make tight-fitting bloomers compulsory.

If it is the former, he shouldn't keep them, if it is the latter he clearly doesn't have the time/energy to even check in on how they are treated once in a while. In which case he shouldn't have them either.\n\nHe should just find them a new home and owner. Then seriously reflect and not get a new pet for a loooooooong time if ever. Preferably once his priorities change or his schedule clears up.\n\nIMO, giving them up is the only way in which he can do right by them at this point. It won't make up for the past but it's the best way forward."", ""I mean they've been like that for 6+ years. If they didn't know than they should've.

The least they could do is make sure the animals they are responsible for aren't mistreated."", ""They are his dogs. Or at least as far as reports go. Apparently GD has a habit of adopting pets that he doesn't have time for then shipping them off ones the new wears off and gets new ones. He didn't bother trying to find new owners for them to take care of them. Instead he used employees of his family bussiness to 'care' for them but never even bothered to check in apparently. Stories of this neglect has been going back to at least 2014. They are still 'his' dogs because he didn't find a new owner for them. But at the same time he couldn't be arsed to check if the people caring for them were doing decent jobs.\n\nLike they've been there for 6+ years AT LEAST. He either knew they were being chained up and didn't care or he never even bothered to find out how they were being kept by the people he chose to care for them.\n\nIf he had NO interest in their well-being at all he should've given them away. But he didn't. He couldn't even be arsed to do what was best for them. Instead he just got more pets.\n\nAt best he is grossly irresponsible and a shitty pet owner and at worst he's a cruel self-centred brat who treats animals as accessories and discards them like trash when he's all done for a newer model.\n\nHe needs to take responsibility and find those dogs a new home. But since these reports have been going on for 6 years and he's never bothered before the chances of that happening are slim to none. Especially since his fans don't even want to admit that he's a human being that made a mistake.\n\nI don't tend to jump on hate bandwaggons. I don't care to 'cancel' this guy or whatever. But he didn't do right by his pets in the past and he needs to do better in the future. He absolutely deserves to be criticised for his irresponsible behaviour. And he never should've adopted pets in the first place when he clearly doesn't have the space/time and energy to care for them."", 'Wtf. If he‚Äôs gonna throw them away after they stop being cute little puppies, the very least he can do is give them up for adoption.\n\nI hope he gets thrown down the shitter for this.

hbggxy,TWICE - Fanfare,"['Korean groups make more money in Korea than Japan, sure. But i\'m not sure kpop is significantly larger (or larger at all) than jpop.\n\nFor example, every year from 2011-2016 [mega boy band arashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arashi)\'s sales revenue was $100-150m USD, which is more than JYPE\'s total revenue in 2019. In 2018, the 4 biggest kpop companies [had a combined revenue of $1B USD](https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/1053724/here-s-how-much-south-korea-s-4-biggest-entertainment-companies-earned-in-2018), compared to the [japanese music industry\'s ~$6.5B revenue](https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/1053724/here-s-how-much-south-korea-s-4-biggest-entertainment-companies-earned-in-2018). Although the last stat probably includes all japanese music, not just ""jpop"", it\'s still 6x the size.', 'Shadow is a banger. My favorite song off the be album other than more &amp; more.', ""wow that's really interesting. I'm guessing Blackpink is too much for Japan then? lol"", 'Equally so, despite how difficult it might be, you shouldn\'t let hmmm insecurities(?) of what others may think to affect your opinion on groups or songs. I\'m not saying that to discredit your opinion, but I also think your lens of viewing and judging Twice is heavily skewed because I dont think fear of ""being mocked by the anti kpop crowd"" is a fair excuse for not liking something. But, that\'s what having an opinion is for, and I do understand your perspective, but I dont agree with it or think it\'s fair.', ""This was a hard comment to word without looking like I was talking down to you/lording over you. This isn't my intention with this comment at all, it's just really hard to word my thoughts. I thought I'd preface it with this, so please read with a pinch of salt.\n\nI can understand your opinion. I speak not knowing your background in this fandom but as someone who would consider themselves 'Old Guard' in the kpop community and I've always felt an onslaught of mockery, when kpop was niche, due to songs like what Twice was putting out at the begining of their career. The bubblegum pop style songs that were dressed up to be taken seriously, if you know what I mean. I also think that the timings were bad for me, as a lifetime SNSD fan I can't help but draw some parallels between Twice and SNSD. That's why I looked at Twice's songs a little more critically back then because in my eyes they were the new generation SNSD, and SNSD (in my opinion.) were in their golden age, in the quality of music sense, when Twice was debuting.\n\nFor me I look at the comebacks for Fancy, Feel Special and More &amp; More and I can just feel the depth of those albums. Stuck in my head is great on Fancy and for Feel Special, my god. Get Loud, Trick It,  Love Foolish and Breakthrough are simply incredible and title songs in their own rights - personally I think all four of those songs are actually better songs than Feel Special. More &amp; More as a title track is honestly a bit lacking, but again I look at the sub tracks: Oxygen, Firework, Shadow, Don't call me again - all incredible.\n\nBut if I look back at Twicecoaster lane 1 it's just 6 bubblepop songs and One In a Million which is a SM style Ballard that leaves a lot to be wanted.\n\nI don't dislike Twice, especially after their recent work. Just for me their older stuff always felt like the music that the anti-kpop crowd would always mock us for back in the day, and here I was looking for things to compete against CMIUC, and the Lion Heart album. I honestly probably imposed such a high level of expectation on them as being JYP's SNSD and that's where my dispising of their early albums comes from. Who knows.

h8yl2v,'SBS' clarifies the misunderstanding behind TWICE's controversial 'Inkigayo' encore fancam,"['Unless you know what vocal training JYP currently gives them and how they act during said training I wouldn‚Äôt assume anything. Given, I don‚Äôt give them pass either though since they‚Äôre a group who‚Äôs been here for like 5 years, and over a hundred encore stages, and they really don‚Äôt sound good here. I was just saying compared to a band who focus solely on singing and playing idols might not be a good comparison in general. Granted, some groups are pretty talented in general but yeah.', 'Lmao. I answered you point by point and you‚Äôre\ngonna come back to ‚ÄúIm not gonna read comments because no substance‚Äù yeah I‚Äôm the worst. Even though I say acknowledge their talent and potential in my comment and I provide actual reason as to why and how they could improve substantially. Sorry unless you‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve done and told tzuyu and momo in person that you‚Äôre proud of how far they‚Äôve come with their singing then fuck off. Keep twice out of your mouth you toxic little shit, you hold ‚Äúfans‚Äù to such a shitty standard you make the whole fandom look bad.', 'Being an idol group doesn‚Äôt give them a pass to be so bad though. The girls weren‚Äôt dancing in the encore stage and they still struggled. Just look at some of their peers like red velvet and blackpink who can sing well. The girls are not at fault though, it‚Äôs jyp who shouldve given them better vocal training', 'No, not this video sorry. I meant the video of Momo singing during the encore. \n\nI‚Äôm not reading your comments cause I know it has no substance. Keep twice‚Äôs name out your mouth, criticism is fine, I never said otherwise and I‚Äôm not gonna entertain someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to read. You hold idols to such an ugly standard of perfection, worst type of person out there. I pity you.', 'I agree with this, there is a vocal range that they should respect and work with, especially now that they are giving them a more ‚Äúgrown up sound‚Äù Jihyo‚Äôs lower register is beautiful and Nayeon wouldn‚Äôt have to strain so much (the Heartshaker chorus was super high too, it‚Äôs ridiculous). I noticed watching Produce 48 that there seems to be an idea that as long as you can reach high notes (even if you‚Äôre straining your voice to hell and practically shouting) you will be considered a ‚Äúgood vocalist‚Äù, there are a lot of ‚Äúhigh note‚Äù competitions about idols too, and it all seems so stupid to me tbh.\n\nAs people with vocal training will certainly know (and most kpop idols will have had some technical training before debut), the range a person has doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with how good they can sound. Lots of contraltos and mezzosopranos have beautiful rich voices, and there‚Äôs zero need to make the poor TWICE girls attempt to sound like a whambulance when none of them can sing as high as the songs they are given, it‚Äôs infuriating.', 'I honestly don‚Äôt care about that. I know that kpop fans take great pride in the technical prowess of the vocalists and dancers, but I‚Äôm just here to listen to some manufactured catchy music to bop to. Yes, some TWICE members are tone deaf (definitely Momo, Sana and Chaeyoung are inconsistent so it‚Äôs hard to tell, Dahyun I think has a good ear but her singing isn‚Äôt the best anyway), but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me, they put on a good show, are fun and entertaining to watch and that‚Äôs all I need.\n\nAnd btw, I‚Äôm not caping for them, I acknowledge that they aren‚Äôt good singers (except for Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, who are aptly the vocal line, Mina is decent although some people don‚Äôt like her vocal color and Tzuyu has improved a lot and is very stable), I just don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant at all for the type of entertainment they offer. \n\nGranted, this is MY OPINION, mostly because I was a fan of J-idols before I got into kpop, and those girls can‚Äôt sing or dance for the most part, they‚Äôre just there to entertain, and make everyone have a good time. That kind of simple enjoyment of idol music is the way I also judge kpop groups like TWICE, and that‚Äôs enough for me.', 'FWIW I think Tzuyu has improved her singing a lot. I also don‚Äôt understand (and never will, because I come from j-pop where idols usually can‚Äôt sing tbh) why are people still salty about the main dancer and sub vocals not being good singers. They have their role in the group, they aren‚Äôt there to belt. I thought it was hilarious how Momo opened her eyes and looked at Nayeon like ‚Äúwow that was so bad lol‚Äù. We Onces love the group because of their charm and their charisma, yes, they aren‚Äôt Mamamoo but also, they don‚Äôt have to be and that‚Äôs fine. \n\nAlso, I agree about JYP being terrible about vocal training, but that‚Äôs a usual thing for his groups isn‚Äôt it? None of his girl groups are known for power vocals or anything like that, and his ‚Äúhalf air‚Äù technique is... a questionable way to sing, at best.', 'Thank you for this. I literally said this exact comment on the thread of the misunderstanding and got downvoted to hell.', 'Day6 is a band tho. Comparing that to a dancing idol group is a bit much no? Got7 I‚Äôm a bit hard pressed to say so since I don‚Äôt really follow their music so I can‚Äôt say. L', 'I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trolling or not. This? Is the video that‚Äôs caused them the most criticism? A video of people murmuring thinking someone misspoke and saying they‚Äôre bad singers? There are literally articles out there that straight up call them bad singers. How is this the worst?\n\nAlso again, if you go to a compilation on YouTube then yeah, most likely everyone is going to laugh about it. It‚Äôs a COMPILATION, it was made after the incident and several put together. That isn‚Äôt a viable source to say ‚Äúit was more widely OK back then‚Äù. Kim Heechul from Super Junior infamously says he‚Äôs still scared of singing because of a voice crack literally near their debut (Miracle I believe the song was) because of all the hate he got.\n\nAgain, who the hell is asking them to be perfect???? You‚Äôre literally the only one setting that up. Everyone is saying ‚Äúplease sing decently‚Äù and I in particular literally mentioned how I prefer their voices during some of their b-side tracks because I know they can sing. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre shit singers, the reason I‚Äôm saying I wish they could sing decently is because like you mention, they have good stages. Their JYP nation vocals are great, their stages where they do songs not originally by girl groups is great. But In comparison to their own title tracks stages, it‚Äôs far from. No one is saying they can‚Äôt fuck up because that‚Äôs ridiculous. How is this so difficult for you? \n\nAlso cherry picking???? The only reason I even brought up groups was because you kept saying ‚Äúother groups don‚Äôt get criticized like this (whether older or same generation as them). I‚Äôve only brought up points with regard to twice, yet you keep bringing in other groups and now you‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm cherry picking lmao.Your issue is you keep making straw man arguments  which just ruins your own credibility because literally anyone can see that you keep defending against  arguments no one is making. And again, just so it‚Äôs clear and you don‚Äôt twist it up again, if someone does something for a living, and they can‚Äôt do it properly CONSISTENTLY then yes, they deserve criticism.  In this case, I‚Äôm saying twice deserve criticism because their vocals COULD be better as we know they have the potential to be. May it be, the next title track is a key lower so no one strains with unrealistic reaches, or a bit slower so they can focus on singing, or whatever works so they can sing live without issues.\n\nYou‚Äôre honestly the worst type of fan. You boil down anything said that isn‚Äôt positive towards your idol as them being toxic lmao. You look into things too much and see things they aren‚Äôt there. I just hope you realize, you‚Äôre the one that people refer to when they say fandom culture can get toxic.', ""&gt; Which, I mean, if you watch the encore, you'll realize why.\n\nHoly crap, that was painful to watch (and listen to...)\n\nI honestly feel so bad for them."", 'The thing that was the catalyst for all this critique is one video, the encore stage. Yes, people have been critiquing Twice‚Äôs live vocals for some time but never to the degree this video triggered. They have had good live vocals, such as JYP NATION encore stages, their concerts, and many more. \n\nI didn‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt receive any critique at all, but it was WIDELY more accepted to have a voice crack or an imperfection in 2nd gen kpop. Just go on YouTube and type in voice crack compilation and you will find numerous videos of 2nd gen mess ups and mistakes with people taking everything lightly and laughing with the idols instead of at them for being imperfect. These don‚Äôt exist anymore, or at least not without starting a fanwar or without ridicule from people.\n\nThe standard of being perfect. Twice has had good stages with good vocals, listen to their discography and each and every one of the members has their moments. Since they messed up this once, people respond with ‚Äúomg twice is horrible at singing?!?‚Äù That standard is ridiculous and appalling. You crave perfection when the human voice isn‚Äôt perfect. \n\nI‚Äôd like to point out the cherry picking as well, Wendy from red velvet is a powerful, wonderful vocalist, but she gets off pitch all the time. Hope you call her a bad singer too if you hold twice to that high standard. Hope you hold every idol who can‚Äôt rap to the same standard too, and who can‚Äôt dance well. \n\nThis is how I know people like you don‚Äôt have good intentions, you sneak shitty stuff like that last line into your critique so when people call you out you can just say that you weren‚Äôt hating you were just ‚Äúcritiquing.‚Äù Just say you hate twice.', 'Nerver sing live during broadcast????? You forget people hating on their vocals during Cheer Up promotion lol????????', ""No I didn't say that. TWICE can even sing most of their regular songs as well. I was just giving ballads a shout out to those who say they posses almost zero technical skill. And no one here is being defensive? I am just stating how I feel and others are too. Yes, I am being mass down voted but I am not sure how that makes me defensive? Anyways, that is fine I was never a giant 2PM fan anyways. I came to point out the inconsistencies in some other peoples statements. Pretty much all I did. If some people got offended by that, then there really isn't much I can do."", 'It‚Äôs actually shocking how terrible they are at live since JYP usually takes pride in talent.

If Twice want to improve their singing then good for them.  If they don't?  Oh well, it wasn't important anyway."", 'Day6 songs are usually very high too but they still sound stable. No offense to Twice but I think any Got7 vocalists and 4/5 of Day6 members can sing circles around the girls', 'Damn thats really far off', 'What was actually said in the commercial is romanized as ""Naui jijeogin imijireur"". \n\nPeople claimed that someone said ""jinjja mosbulleo jyaene"".. \n\nSo yeah, not that similar lmao', 'I can\'t argue it any further because I don\'t feel like I have enough information if you won\'t directly engage with the question, if you know what I mean? Like, I asked for a brief explanation of what is superior in her technique when compared to those idols and you just vaguely repeated that they aren\'t any better than TWICE, so... I don\'t know what I\'m supposed to do with that. Also, edits and replies are getting jumbled because I\'m more slow with responding, so we might be talking over each other without meaning to.\n\nI just feel like you\'re being defensive because you came into a thread where people were saying ""groups X, Y and Z were able to sing live with choreography in the past and still give good performances"" and all you\'ve had to say is ""but they sing their ballads live"" when that\'s not what anyone was talking about. And now ""well, they\'re not accustomed to this song."" Like, it\'s a song that they practiced over and over for weeks in order to have their comeback. How are they not used to it? What should it take for them to get accustomed? It\'s weird.\n\nI can\'t speak for any of the other groups because 2PM is the only one I follow closely, and I think a lot of people only remember their early years when it comes to their vocals so I don\'t believe we\'d be on the same page about it. The difference that I feel between them, as a fan of 2PM and someone who was also a fan of TWICE in past, is that 2PM was pushed more heavily to always sing live from the time they started out, which built up into greater confidence, proficiency and stability over time (which I can also speak to as I\'ve seen them live) that TWICE has not necessarily been given the opportunity to develop due to changes in the industry. This is what I feel the comment was talking about when reminiscing on second gen groups, not saying that these groups were all full of flawless singers with immaculate technique.', 'Dreamcatcher', 'I acknowledge this performance of theirs wasn‚Äôt the best or that they aren‚Äôt amazing singers, but they are definitely competent and good in most cases. People like to isolate this one stage and use it as the defining moment of twice‚Äôs vocals for all 5 years of live stages. Sounds pretty hateful to me to cherry pick moments to allow your ‚Äúcritique.‚Äù Idols don‚Äôt have to sing perfectly 24/7, people on broadway mess up all the time but that doesn‚Äôt make them any worse of a singer. Don‚Äôt. Expect. Perfection. From. People.', ""Well I have been dancing for 15 years and singing for about 7 years at this point. Though I would say my talent lies more within dancing than singing but the artist they mentioned aren't much more superior than TWICE if at all vocally.\n\nThey have sang their ballads just fine live. Which is what I am saying. You keep bringing up them struggling with a song that isn't something they are accustomed to at all. To pretend that the groups this guy mentioned, I have been into K-Pop 10 years, and act like their lives weren't dusty even 5+ years in the game is a joke.""]"

There actually weren\'t many quotes from her in the article, but this comment may get a little long anyway since I think I should explain why I feel like there\'s a disconnect between the original Japanese and the translations that went around at the time.\n\nBasically, she describes being a fan of Big Bang who ended up in his social circle in Japan, got invited to a party where he was at and they hit it off and exchanged phone numbers. They texted for a while and he eventually invited her to his place. (She went to the magazine anonymously, but I believe her identity was leaked after the article came out and she turned out to be a model, IIRC, not a prostitute from a separate scandal of his unrelated to this one.) \n\nHer statement: ""Going into his room late at night, he seemed drunk, and as we sat on his bed and talked, we got in the mood... I was his fan, so of course I was happy, but in the middle of sex, he repeatedly choked me. I suppose it must be his fetish to take \\[sexual\\] pleasure in seeing someone\'s unwilling face.""\n\nÊÄßÁôñ (seiheki) is the word that became ""habit"" in English translations. It does mean tendency, etc., but another meaning for it in sexual contexts is fetish, which I believe is more accurate to how she used it. The translation most people are familiar with essentially chopped up her words and combined sentences, taking only ÊÄßÁôñ from the sentence where she clearly states ""unwillingness"" and transposing it onto the previous sentence to create the phrase ""habit of choking"" that sounds as if she accepted and knew about it, which makes me question if an inaccurate translation was intentionally given to make him sound less at fault.\n\nAlso, the suffix she used when saying ""he choked me"" can mean *he did things like ...* or *he did this as well as other (similar) things*, potentially implying other rough acts she didn\'t specify, but I hesitate to write that directly into the translation without more to confirm it.

At The Disco song, with a slightly different genre - particularly like *There's a Good Reason these Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of it Yet*. I can already imagine how insane the stage will be. I'm so excited for the performance for this one. \n\n**New World:** this really does feel like an anime ost and it makes me want to go on some huge life altering adventure. \n\n**Basquiat:** definitely impressed with this one. pentagon in general has always been a little hit or miss for me (both with their music and the RTK stages) but this one is definitely a hit. Almost gives me old school, radioactive era Imagine Dragons vibes. Very soundtracky, like New World, but for a live action film not an anime \n\n**Beautiful-x:** i love love retro funky songs! this one is the most summery and fun and it'll definitely be a breath of fresh air in performances. \n\n**Come Back Home:** the vocals were insane in this and I did really like it! i think the others just edged it out by a bit. \n\noverall, ONF and The Boyz have impressed me a ton this whole series. ironically, they were both groups that I've known about since pre-debut (followed ONF on MixNine and i liked Haknyeon from broduce) but I never got around to listening to their stuff, mainly because I assumed since the members were younger than me, their concept would be too youthful to my tastes (which honestly I ended up being wrong about because Hyojin, E-tion and I are the same age whoops). I'm definitely going to check out all the groups now. \n\nThis is what I love about this show series!!!

Even if you did not know they would not be received well by the fans when making Basquiat, you should have known that you are going to show 4 performances in a row with 3 basically being copies of each other -facepalm- This could have been the best moment for them to do either an upbeat song that would wow others like Energetic, or if you reeeally insist on a moody song something like Like This would be LIT, instead you choose to come up with a song that could have been from Monsta X's discography :("", 'Do the clean and full performance videos count towards the online performance score?

I think it's offensive to international fans to downplay the attention and money we put into supporting groups we love to treat us differently than Korean fans, and that's something that I think happens all too often.\n\nThat said, if you're just a bit bummed based on the possible results of international votes I don't see any problem with being bummed about it.

The international community may have different tastes, or a group may have spent more time promoting internationally.

As the ending says, the moonlight sonata is key/giving them power to create paradise.\n* The door appears! Sunwoo is trying to get to the other side? I didn't quite understand this part. \n* Now The Boyz have petals on them. They get around New, indicating that they are now ready to make flowers bloom.\n* Younghoon, a lonely god, sees them and plucks a branch from the garden of paradise (?).

They‚Äôre incredibly creative and I hope more ifans start joining the Deobi fandom!\n\nI know a lot of people think that The Boyz are just a pretty boy group that manages to sing and dance a bit, but they‚Äôre truly a special and talented group. If you‚Äôve been watching the show, you can see how hard they‚Äôve been working! Quite honestly, I think that if Gidle &amp; OMG set the bar on Queendom, The Boyz set the bar on Road to Kingdom. We‚Äôve seen them go above and beyond with their sets, and that encouraged the other groups to be inspired and also go above and beyond with their own stages in their own unique way.', 'Younghoona already recovered from his injury as I remember.

Rather, they were inspired to go a different route and put their own touch on this concept, which I think was a good idea, seeing as doing more of an exact copy/cover probably wouldn‚Äôt have been as interesting for this competition.

They mostly just seemed to use the Egyptian theme for visuals, which was a lot less impressive. Also, for outfits specifically, I didn't like that Hongseok and Yuto just had jackets with no shirt underneath (and to a lesser extent, Yeo One with the sheer undershirt). Yes I like abs, but just having it like that from the beginning leaves no impact and is instead, slightly distracting the whole time cuz like am I supposed to look at the abs or the performance? Their dancing was super powerful, but some of the solo/pair dances were a little boring. There was also a lot of screaming as part of it, but it was just wasn't my favorite haha. 5/10\n\nVERIVERY: So I don't get the connection between Aladdin and Gogobebe but it was such a fun concept visually and in terms of performance aspects that I can't really complain! The only thing was the first flying carpet scene, which was a bit lame since they were literally just sitting on a carpet on the ground haha. But the group dances and individual parts were all super interesting and fun. And then the costumes were all so fun, and Jafar even had an appearance (the floating staff thing WAS super cool!) but throughout the whole thing so many people rubbed the lamp I kept expecting a genie but never saw one? Also I'm not really sure why they chose to do it as a one-take, I understand it's more challenging, but since it's a live stage anyway, I just don't really know what it added. OH and I didn't even really notice the member dropping the staff, it didn't really seem like a mistake somehow. Such a fun stage regardless though, so great job VERIVERY! This is probably my favorite performance of theirs so far. 8/10\n\nThe Boyz: Against all odds, The Boyz have yet again exceeded my now exceedingly high expectations of them. I keep telling myself they couldn't possibly impress me again and yet somehow, they manage to do so every week. This time, they not only beautifully expressed a journey to paradise, but incorporated classical music and a different style of dance into their performance. What can these boys not do? Also, I love that whatever they do, they fully commit to it. I don't know much about contemporary dance, but their outfits looked flowy and appropriate, and they weren't even wearing shoes! There are almost too many great moments to talk about, but no one can convince me it wasn't intentional that they put the pink-haired New in the center for the peach blossom part. And then Younghoon's part behind the screen was super original. My favorite part is a toss-up though - I can't choose between the beautiful ballet-like part in the beginning with Hyunjae reaching out or the sequence at the end where the members held a progressively-blooming flower in their hands as they danced. Juyeon's mistake in that last part was noticeable though (since it went from slowly blooming back to just a naked branch again briefly), so that's a shame. But still, what a performance. 9/10"", 'Honorable mentions for TOO... their rising sun performance is up there in my frequently rewatched RTK performances. Especially Chan and Kyungho, who I felt hard carried the group and made their performances go from good to mesmerizing. I felt bad that they were eliminated, but it was the right choice. They are young, they have everything that they need to come back with a whole new set of fans from the show (and have another single besides Magnolia, lol).', 'Agree so hard! As much as I like Pentagon as a group, I don\'t find myself compelled to rewatch their performances (maybe except Very Good, because Kino is on fire there). I think they are super talented, but they haven\'t been able to show versatility in the show. They\'ve become predictable and unfortunately while I think their comeback song is good it sounds like their finale performance will be more of the same. \n\nAlso, it\'s a funny to me that Pengaton is the only group in the competition that look like MEN and give off super manly vibes. Even though some of the other contestants in the other groups are older than members of Pentagon, it really feels like Pentagon are seniors in age. I think it\'s also because the members of Pentagon aren\'t afraid to be ""artists"" on stage with their costumes,looks or hair; they\'re not performing to seduce or look attractive, but to tell a story. In that way I think that they\'re completely unique compared to the other groups; much more like Big Bang or Block B than a cookie cutter boy group.', ""I made my husband watch the latest episode with me and even he loved ONF's reactions XD \n\nHyojin is seriously a star. He crushed it in It's Raining. I was only loosely following MixNine but I can totally see why he would have made it into the final group."", ""Yes! My one gripe about Oneus is that they have so few members and like... 100x backup dancers. And for some reason, the backup dancers are always in the foreground (as opposed to in the back, where they should be?!) and the camera is never focused on any one member. I thought this was an issue with Warrior's Descendants, Be Mine, and even LIT.\n\nHwanwoong's expressions are truly the best, though. He shines no matter where he is on stage!"", ""I wish Pentagon had a chance to do a lighthearted song (e.g., Gogobebe) where they could show off their goofy side. Don't get me wrong, the performance of Follow was excellent - but I think they haven't quite shown a new side of them with the aggressive and dominating performances they've been doing so far (Shine + Spring Snow doesn't count)."", ""This was the first time that my ranking would be completely different from the final one. Until now it has lined up almost perfectly. For this round, mine would be:\n\n\\*disclaimer: i don't stan or even really follow any of the groups, apart from having a couple of songs in my playlist from some of them. So, completely imparcial\\*\n\n1.**The Boyz** \\- Once again completely exceeded my expectations. The choreo was absolutely perfect and perfectly delivered imo. I was in awe throughout the whole performance. They did what i, at the time, said that Golden Child failed to perfectly deliver in their T.O.P. performance.\n\n2/3. **Verivery/Pentagon** \\- Verivery's concept was really well thought out and was really well delivered. The fact it was all in one take, with a lot of intricacies and they managed to pull it off was amazing. Pentagon's performance was really powerful and chilling. The energy they put out gave me goosebumps. Was totally not expecting such a low score, with that big of a gap. Both performances were really good in their own way, and they were so different. Can't really say which was better.\n\n4. **ONF** \\- I was really not expecting them to be first AT ALL. I mean, the arrangement was amazing. The performance was also good but it didn't really stand out at all for me, especially when compared to the others. It felt kinda simple? When i evaluate the performances i tend to give a much higher significance to the performance/vocals, than the actual arrangement, since in most of them it's not the actual members that have a big role in making them, so it seems kinda unfair ig? Anyway, really not expecting it, maybe the song choice + arrangement played a big part in it?\n\n5. **ONEUS** \\- I really liked the overall performance and story. Didn't get as immersed in it as the top 3 tho. Comparing to ONF, i liked ONEUS' performance a little more but liked ONF's song way more. As i think i enjoyed watching ONF's more, i might give them the edge. But close tho.\n\n6. **TOO** \\- Fair number of mistakes and the performance felt kinda forgetable. They have a bright future tho. Already a big achievement getting to this stage.\n\nBut this was definitely the hardest round to rank so far. I'm saying this but my opinion may completely change after watching the performances a couple of times more. They were all so good.\n\nAs the end is approaching, i'm really sad that at least the first 3 won't all go to Kingdom...i'm too emotionally attached to see anyone coming short in the end :("", ""At this point I know it's just wishful thinking but I want ONEUS to feature one of their MAMAMOO sunbaenims as a secret weapon."", 'I see a lot of people attribute the votes on the contestant side but honestly it might be from the audience too (the audience is chosen from the fans if the audience votes the same way as the contestants (by ranking the groups). \n\nFor the three leading groups it is safest to vote for Oneus in second place (with their own group in first) because Oneus would be least likely to score higher than their group.\n\nThis is of course a cynical POV, and I‚Äôm sure that some of the audience loved what I love about Oneus‚Äôs performances, but I know myself well enough to know that if I was in the audience the quality of the performances might have a little effect on how I vote but I would absolutely not vote for anyone that could get in the way of the group I was there to support.', 'Totally agree with you! I have a lot of respect for Pentagon and especially Hui for their talents, it‚Äôs really sad to see them struggle so much after 3.5 years of debut. \n\nI have to say, i think one of the reasons why The Boyz is doing so well is that they keep audience‚Äôs enjoyment at the forefront while planning their stage. The same goes for the remaining groups actually (to varying degrees of success, my fave is ONF). Personally i feel that is one factor that might be a bit lacking from Pentagon, they seem to be approaching the rounds with the mentality of proving ‚Äúwe are the best‚Äù as the priority, rather than giving the audience a good viewing experience. I think it gives rise to a certain vibe in their performance that might not stick with the general public. \n\nReally hope all the teams will give their best for the final stage and the audience will vote for them objectively instead of simply going by fanbase size!!', ""I can't speak for the other groups because I don't follow them closely, but The Boyz are definitely getting tons of exposure through RtK, both from in Korea and internationally. Their comeback song CHECKMATE charted at 61 on Melon (their first song to chart on Melon since debut), and their SNS, fancafe, and vlive numbers are breaking personal records every other day. Plus their international fandom was always pretty small, so the fact that they tied with PTG in Whosfan would've been unbelievable to me a couple months ago."", ""onf probably have the biggest korean fanbase out of any of the groups atm, looking at views/individual listeners on korean sites\n\nit's almost definitely onf and the boyz that will make it just from fanbase size"", 'English subs are now available!', 'Hello!

Thanks for this\\~', 'Edit: haha I replied to the wrong comment\\~', 'VAMPIRE SQUIRREL intensifies', ""My expectations were also pretty high considering how amazing the last rounds were. And what you said about ONF is so accurate. I think The Boyz did do the paradise concept which is what shangri-la means, so I think they did something specific to the song/maintained that original ethereal VIXX vibe but still executed their own interpretation pretty well. Not as eye catching as their last 3 performances and maybe could've had a more grand arrangement, but maybe it'll take some time to grow on me."", 'When I wake up on Friday it‚Äôs usually there lol, so a day or so, I think not much more than 24 hours. :)', 'Hi!

Of course the thot had to jump out of WayV... ‚Äútouch me after midnight‚Äù üòÇ This is nice, the first 3 were on a different level for me. \n\nInterlude/Only Human - definitely a NCT-esque interlude lol. Following it with Only Human is pretty funny since it starts with some clean electric guitar and a much chiller vibe. The song is great though. A nice reprieve from the intensity. Could definitely hear a western pop star over this. \n\n\nDomino - another song with big EXO b-side vibes. The huge wall of vocal harmonies is like a time machine. \n\nUp From Here - this one grooves. Very smooth and a catchy melody. For some reason the melody/instrumental reminds me a bit of something Red Velvet would do. There‚Äôs a whimsical aspect. Great song. \n\nElectric Hearts - when they said E LEC TRIC HEARTS that way my head went to f(x)‚Äôs Electric Shock. This is definitely the Love Me Now of the album, though. \n\n\nStand By Me - another time machine song. Very tried and true boy group pop. Not my cup of tea, but I guess it‚Äôs one of those anthemic fan songs during which people cry at concerts. \n\nOverall, the album is frontloaded for me. The first 3 songs are incredible - some of the biggest bangers of the year. The whole album is good, but nothing comes close to the raw energy that courses through my body during the beginning.

If Jeongyeon wanted to be silent about the injury (absolutely fair), and JYPE agreed (absolutely fair), and they asked broadcast stations not to divulge those fancams and those broadcast stations were OK with that, as I said, all of that is absolutely fair. Whether it is what I would have done as artist or staff is another matter, but both the artist and the company have the absolute right to do those things.\n\nWhat I don\'t agree is with the comments of ""omg the fans should\'ve chilled out!!!!!!!"". JYPE and Jeongyeon decided not to make something public, which had the consequence of not uploading fancams (something that is extremely weird in any normal circumstance, including injuries). Fans wanting to know if something was wrong is a consequence of those actions, and I don\'t think the fans overstepped at any point in this matter.', ""Well, as we've come to see, completely leaving fans in the dark drew attention and made it an issue all the same.  There's plenty of ways they can announce that her fancams aren't being uploaded without disclosing her condition. All they really had to say is that it's her personal choice and leave it at that. Would that have satisfied everyone? No, but it would've been better than complete radio silence. It was bad communication on JYPE's part, and I don't blame fans one bit for their concern."", ""Not really. If Jeongyeon didn't want her condition known, there really isn't a way for JYPE to announce anything without drawing attention and making it an issue. If a company suddenly releases a statement saying were not going to have a member's fancams put up, but don't worry, everything's fine: they will start a rumor cycle about whether that member is leaving the group, if there's some scandal that's going to drop involving that member, are they being singled out/held back due to nepotism. In other words you take something that the member wants to keep private, and not only make it public, but bring unwanted speculation and attention to the matter."", ""All these comments and hashtags with respect is just buzz from Twitter without any real insight. They just shout out words loud enough to be a voice in that sns. It's was the same with the loona manager, and other cases too. \n\n\nWe can only see abusive stuff about the company when the idols go public about the management after the contract ends, which was the case with the Stellar girls and a bunch of other examples, or some stupid manager caught in a Vlive being an asshole."", ""So let me throw something out there: what if Jeongyeon didn't want her injury to be public knowledge? After all, they had already had it checked, and it wasn't life threatening or keep her from promotions. She felt brave enough to have JYPE ask for her fancams not to be put up, so it's not too much of a stretch to think that she asked JYPE not to publicize her injury. If JYPE hasn't to chose between doing right by their artists in personal matters or letting the public in on artists' affairs, I hope they side with the artist."", '""Freedom gone"", so what?
